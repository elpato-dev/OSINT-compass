# OSINT Compass
OSINT Compass is a powerful tool that allows users to collect, organize, and analyze open-source information from various sources. It provides an integrated search engine to gather relevant information, a social media monitoring interface, and the ability to store and organize data in different formats.

Moreover, OSINT Compass uses machine learning technologies to help users identify important trends and patterns in the collected information. The tool also allows users to create reports and presentations based on the collected information to gain insights into important topics or trends.

## Submodules
This repository includes two submodules: the `OSINT-compass-engine` and the `OSINT-compass-portal`. The `OSINT-compass-engine` submodule contains the backend of the OSINT Compass tool, which handles the data storage, processing, and analysis. The `OSINT-compass-portal` submodule provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the tool.

To use OSINT Compass, please clone the repository and initialize the submodules. For more information, please refer to the documentation included in each submodule.
